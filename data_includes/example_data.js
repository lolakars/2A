<div style = "width: 40em;">
<font face = "Arial"> <p> Below, you will see a series of sentences that you will have to score depending on how acceptable they seem to you. To do this, you will have to use a scale from 1 (not acceptable at all) to 7 (totally acceptable) </p>

<p> A sentence is totally acceptable when hearing it you can easily understand it and it sounds natural to you, that is, a native speaker could use it in a conversation. A sentence is totally unacceptable when it doesn't make sense and / or doesn't sound natural to you, that is, a native speaker would never say something like that. Therefore, do not think about the grammar rules that you could have learned in school or institute, be guided by your intuitions. </p>
